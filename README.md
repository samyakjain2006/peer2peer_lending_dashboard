# 💸 Peer-to-Peer Lending System

A mini banking web application that allows users to lend and borrow money directly from each other — without a traditional bank. This system tracks users, loans, payments, overdue alerts, and reliability scores using a clean dashboard interface and MySQL backend.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This web-based system allows:

- 👤 **User registration** as either a lender or a borrower
- 💰 **Loan creation** between users
- 🧾 **Payment tracking** against existing loans
- 🔔 **Overdue alerts** for missed payments
- 📊 **Reliability score** calculation based on payment behavior
- 📂 **Loan history** viewing and management

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- **Lenders** offer money via the "Create Loan" feature.
- **Borrowers** receive loans and can make repayments.
- **Admins** can track who paid, who missed payments, and how trustworthy each user is.

Each feature is available through a structured and simple UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
